description: When working with anything Wix-related
---

Strictly adhere to the documentation for Wix JavaScript SDK, which can be found here: https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk

Analyze the documentation and make notes on the sections related to the project at hand. Review these notes when resuming work on projects that interact with Wix. Make sure that only Wix JavaScript SDK is used. 
----
When handling anything involving Wix, ensure the documentation for Wix JavaScript SDK is strictly followed. Do not use Direct API method of communicating with Wix. Everything should be formatted exactly how it appears in the Wix JavaScript SDK and every part is included. 

Important pages from the SDK documentation include the following:

For Pricing Plans: ecom > Orders > getOrders() 
[https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/ecom/orders/get-order]

----
Also, when working with the portions of the application involving communications between the app and the Anviz C2 Pro Fingerprint Scanner, strictly adhere to the documentation "New SDK API 2021".

----

Do not use a simulation for anything. Ever. It is never okay to simulate a function or process or result. We need to make sure the application is actually functioning and making successful connections.
